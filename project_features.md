## 4. Snake AI Identification

### Image Analysis
- Image upload and preview.
- Fresh analysis whenever the selected image changes.
- Previous results cleared when a new image is selected.
- Error handling for failed analysis.

### Snake / Not-Snake
- Determine whether the image contains a snake.
- Support a NOT_SNAKE negative class where included in the trained model.
- Avoid forcing unrelated images into a snake class.

### Species & Venom
- Classify supported snake species using the trained CNN pipeline.
- Determine venomous/non-venomous status.
- Display species, venom status, and confidence where available.
- Use the actual trained model class mapping rather than an incorrect hard-coded mapping.

### Reporting Gate
- A venomous result can expose an option for the citizen to report the sighting.
- Reporting remains a user action separate from prediction.

## 5. Snake Sighting Reports
Reports can contain:
- Snake species.
- Venom status.
- Image/result information.
- Sighting location.
- Latitude/longitude.
- Date/time.
- Report status.
- Ranger assignment/response information where applicable.

Reports are stored in the database and made available to authorized authorities.

## 6. Geographic Location
- Browser GPS detection.
- Latitude/longitude capture.
- Location display.
- Coordinate storage.
- Geographic report visualization.
- Location-aware Ranger matching.
- Haversine distance calculation where coordinates are available.

## 7. Authority GIS Map
The Authority Map is the primary Authority incident-management interface.

Features:
- Dedicated `/authority/map/` page.
- Authority login redirects directly to the map.
- Map is the first major item in the Authority navbar.
- Individual snake report markers.
- Marker colors/statuses.
- Marker popups.
- Report details.
- Species and venom information.
- Coordinates.
- Ranger assignment from report details.
- Nearby available Ranger discovery.
- Assignment/status tracking.

### Authority Navbar
```text
Map | Risk Zones | Wound Checker | Emergency SOS | Profile | User Identity | Logout
```

There must be only one Logout button.

## 8. Ranger Assignment
Authorities assign Rangers to specific reports.

### Matching
Filter Rangers by:
- Ranger role.
- Availability.
- Registered location.
- Coordinates.
- Distance from incident.

When coordinates exist, Haversine distance can rank nearby Rangers.

### Assignment Workflow
```text
ASSIGNED
   ↓
ACCEPTED
   ↓
ON_THE_WAY
   ↓
AT_LOCATION
   ↓
COMPLETED
```

Optional states:
- DECLINED
- CANCELLED

Object-level security ensures a Ranger sees only assigned incidents.

## 9. DBSCAN Risk Zones
- Spatial clustering of snake reports.
- Geographic hotspot identification.
- Cluster visualization.
- Authority-level risk monitoring.
- Separate Risk Zones feature from individual incident management.

## 10. Wound / Snake-Bite Checker
Separate AI workflow:
```text

    ↓

```

Referenced model:
`venom_watch_snakebite_efficientnetb0.keras`

## 11. Emergency SOS
- Emergency-response interface.
- Accessible through the application navigation.
- Supports emergency-response information/workflows implemented by the project.

## 12. Profile
- User profile page.
- Account information.
- Role information.
- Ranger operational information where applicable.
- Navbar identity area links to `/accounts/profile/`.

## 13. Security & Access Control

### Citizen
Can access citizen functionality, own reports, AI analysis, wound checker, and emergency functionality.

Cannot access Authority-only incident management or Ranger administration.

### Authority
Can access Authority Map, incident management, Ranger assignment, Risk Zones, and Authority operational tools.

### Ranger
Can access assigned incidents and Ranger operational functions.

Cannot access Authority dashboard, all reports, other Rangers' assignments, or assignment controls.

### Admin
Has administrative/system-level access according to Django permissions.

## 14. Map & Marker System
- Leaflet-based interactive maps where currently used.
- Individual report markers.
- Marker status/colors.
- Species and venom information.
- Coordinates.
- Marker click → report details.
- Report details → Ranger assignment.

The map basemap should use a legitimate configured provider and must not depend on an invalid CARTO/API-key configuration.
